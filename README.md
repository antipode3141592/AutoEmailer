Occassionally, I need to mail custom reports to multiple clients/customers.
For simplicity sake, this code utilizes the win32com library to control an instance of
Outlook, though you could easily modify this code to use another e-mail client/service.
It also uses the pandas library for its powerful and easy to use data analysis tools.

I intend this code as an example (that I actually use) of using python to automate a simple,
repetive task.  It also illustrates a simple use of pandas, which is a great library to
learn for data analysis.  This code uses the GNU GPL v3 license, so I encourage you to take and modify
this code to suit your needs!
